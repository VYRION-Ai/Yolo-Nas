Introducing the groundbreaking YOLO-NAS architecture! This state-of-the-art design boasts unparalleled accuracy-speed performance, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in object detection.

To begin your training journey, simply install the super-gradients library version 3.1.1 with the following command:

!pip install -q super-gradients==3.1.1

After installation is complete, don't forget to restart the runtime by navigating to Runtime -> Restart runtime and confirming with a simple click of "Yes".

Next, clone the YOLO-NAS repository from GitHub:

!git clone https://github.com/totoadel/Yolo-Nas.git

You'll then want to add your dataset to the mix. To do this, use the following code snippet with Google Colab:

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
%cd /content/
%cp /content/drive/MyDrive/Master/yolo_dataset.zip /content/
!unzip  /content/yolo_dataset.zip
!rm  /content/yolo_dataset.zip

And finally, it's time to start training! Navigate to the YOLO-NAS directory and run the following command to begin your project:

%cd /content/Yolo-Nas
!python train.py --project "Dataset"  --data /content/Dataset/data.yaml --location '/content/Dataset' --model-arch yolo_nas_s --batch-size 16 --max-epochs 25 --checkpoint-dir /content/checkpoints

With YOLO-NAS, your object detection endeavors are sure to reach new heights. Happy training!
