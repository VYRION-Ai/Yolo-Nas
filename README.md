# Yolo-Nas
Ready to deploy pre-trained SOTA models

YOLO-NAS architecture is out! The new YOLO-NAS delivers state-of-the-art performance with the unparalleled accuracy-speed performance, outperforming other models such as YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7 and YOLOv8. Check it out here: YOLO-NAS.

# Load model with pretrained weights
from super_gradients.training import models
from super_gradients.common.object_names import Models

model = models.get(Models.YOLO_NAS_M, pretrained_weights="coco")

All Computer Vision Models - Pretrained Checkpoints can be found in the Model Zoo

Easy to train SOTA Models

Easily load and fine-tune production-ready, pre-trained SOTA models that incorporate best practices and validated hyper-parameters for achieving best-in-class accuracy. For more information on how to do it go to Getting Started
Plug and play recipes

python -m super_gradients.train_from_recipe architecture=regnetY800 dataset_interface.data_dir=<YOUR_Imagenet_LOCAL_PATH> ckpt_root_dir=<CHEKPOINT_DIRECTORY>

More example on how and why to use recipes can be found in Recipes
Production readiness

All SuperGradients modelsâ€™ are production ready in the sense that they are compatible with deployment tools such as TensorRT (Nvidia) and OpenVINO (Intel) and can be easily taken into production. With a few lines of code you can easily integrate the models into your codebase.

# Load model with pretrained weights
from super_gradients.training import models
from super_gradients.common.object_names import Models

model = models.get(Models.YOLO_NAS_M, pretrained_weights="coco")

# Prepare model for conversion
# Input size is in format of [Batch x Channels x Width x Height] where 640 is the standard COCO dataset dimensions
model.eval()
model.prep_model_for_conversion(input_size=[1, 3, 640, 640])
    
# Create dummy_input

# Convert model to onnx
torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input,  "yolo_nas_m.onnx")

More information on how to take your model to production can be found in Getting Started notebooks
